# Advent of Code 2025 in Rust

My [Advent of Code 2025][aoc-2025] solutions in the Rust programming language.
This repository holds a separate Rust project for each day and part.

I attempt to develop a standalone, elegant, compact and fast solution for each
problem (two each day).

Three years ago I did the same, solving everything in under a second:

## Timings

Here is how long each solution runs with my input. All solutions are measured
(non scientifically) in [`bench.rs`](./runner/src/bin/bench.rs) on an `AMD Ryzen
9 5900X (24) @ 3.7GHz` machine running Linux.

## Run solutions

Each Rust project needs a `input.txt` file to run, holding the puzzle input.
Simply create this file with your input and run the project to see the solution
appear.

```bash
# Switch to day 1a, add input, and run it
cd day01a
nano input.txt
cargo +nightly run --release

# or run everything in parallel
cd ../runner
cargo +nightly run --release --bin runner-par

# or benchmark every day
cd ../runner
cargo +nightly run --release --bin bench
```

Some solutions require Rust Nightly, that's why `+nightly` is included.

Sadly I cannot include my puzzle input anymore to make each solution easily
runnable as per Advent of Code

> If you're posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of
> Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs.
